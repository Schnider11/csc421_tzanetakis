    "Problems can be solved by searching the state space. The state space is a representation of a problem where the nodes are states and the edges between them are actions. Domain-specific heuristics can be used to estimate the cost of reaching the goakl from a given state to make searching for solutions more efficient. The state representation is treated as a black box. \n",
