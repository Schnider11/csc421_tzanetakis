    "\n",
    "   This approach to AI aims to better understand how humans think/accomplish various tasks. It is informed by Cognitive science which explores how humans perform various tasks. As an example of this approach we might be interested in developing computer models of how humans play chess or some other board game. The goals of these models is to better understand what strategies humans use to make decisions in this context including thier limitations rather than developing the \"best\" computer chess playing program that could use a completely different approach to playing.   \n",

    "   Aristotle established logic as a way to formalize thinking. Logic deals with relationships and abstracts the process of reasoning so that it is independent of the specific categories used. For example one can have the following thinking \"patterns\":\n",
    "\n",
    "   * All dogs are animals. Robin is a dog. Therefore robin is an animal.\n",
    "   * Every student has a computer. Each computer has a mouse. Therefore, every students has a mouse.\n",
    "   \n",
    "    Such patterns can be used to derive information that we don't know from facts that we know. For example if one knows that the parents of Bart are Homer and Marge, one can infer that Marge has a child named Bart. \n",

    "3. **Act like humans**\n",
    "\n",
    "    The first proposal for evaluating success in AI was building a program that acts humanly named after Allan Turing. To be considered intelligent a program must be able to act sufficiently like a human to fool an interrogator. A human interrogates the program and another human via a terminal simultaneously. If after a reasonable period, the interrogator cannot tell which is which, the program passes. Passing the Turing test requires natural language procesing, knowledge representation, automated reasoning, and machine learning all of which have been active areas of research since the dawn of AI in the 1950s. One could also add computer visiion and audition as well as robotics as additional challenges while keeping the successful immitation aspects of the test the same. \n",
